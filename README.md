# neuralSimPython

NeuralSimPython is a flexible framework for fitting parameters of neural models to data that wraps open source genetic algorithm tools 
and custom codes for building models and numerical simulation.

It provides the user with a simple framework for building models, specifying evalution functions for fitting and then easily employing 
the DEAP (https://deap.readthedocs.io/en/master/) library to perform the fitting to data using genetic algorithms.
